> Get started on Next.js with TypeScript by just a single click

This is an example setup of Next.js building on top of (the official TypeScript example)[https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-typescript]. It adds the following:
* Basic Prettier setup
* ESLint config with (eslint-config-kentcdodds)[https://github.com/kentcdodds/eslint-config-kentcdodds] and a few rules that I often use.
* TypeScript typechecking as part of `test` script (ready to plug into any CI)
* Update regularly

## How to Use

Execute (create-next-app)[https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app] with (npm)[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init] or (Yarn)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/] to bootstrap the example:

```
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/hanihusam/han-nextts-quickstart han-nextts-quickstart-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/hanihusam/han-nextts-quickstart han-nextts-quickstart-app

```
